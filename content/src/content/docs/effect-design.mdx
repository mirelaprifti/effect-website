# Effect Design System

Effect's design system is built on principles of clarity, performance, and developer experience. Our visual language reflects the library's core values: type safety, composability, and elegance.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Functional Aesthetics**
Just as Effect brings functional programming to TypeScript, our design brings functional principles to visual communication. Every element serves a purpose, with no unnecessary decoration.

### 2. **Type-Safe Design**
Our design system mirrors Effect's type safety through consistent, predictable patterns. Components follow strict guidelines ensuring visual consistency across all touchpoints.

### 3. **Composable Elements**
Like Effect's compositional programming model, our design elements are modular and composable. Small, reusable components combine to create complex interfaces.

## Visual Identity

### Typography

Our typography system emphasizes readability and hierarchy:

- **Display**: Bold, confident headings that command attention
- **Body**: Clear, readable text optimized for documentation
- **Code**: Monospace fonts that make code examples stand out

### Color Palette

Effect's color palette balances professionalism with approachability:

- **Primary**: Deep blue representing trust and stability
- **Accent**: Vibrant highlights for interactive elements
- **Semantic**: Clear colors for success, warning, and error states
- **Neutral**: Grays for backgrounds and secondary content

### Spacing & Layout

We use an 8-point grid system ensuring consistent spacing:

- **Tight** (4px): For related elements
- **Default** (8px): Standard spacing
- **Loose** (16px): Between sections
- **Spacious** (32px+): Major section breaks

## Component Patterns

### Interactive Elements

All interactive components follow these principles:

- **Clear affordances**: Users know what's clickable
- **Responsive feedback**: Immediate visual response to interactions
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigable with clear focus states

### Code Examples

Code is a first-class citizen in Effect's design:

```typescript
// Syntax highlighting that matches our brand
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* Effect.succeed(42)
  return result
})
```

### Documentation Layout

Our documentation design prioritizes:

- **Scannable content**: Clear headings and sections
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex topics revealed gradually
- **Interactive learning**: Embedded playgrounds for experimentation

## Motion & Animation

Animations in Effect are:

- **Purposeful**: Every animation has a functional reason
- **Performant**: No animation at the cost of performance
- **Subtle**: Enhancing, not distracting from content

## Dark Mode

Effect embraces dark mode as a first-class experience:

- **True blacks**: OLED-friendly dark backgrounds
- **Reduced eye strain**: Carefully balanced contrast
- **Consistent experience**: Same design quality in both modes

## Accessibility

Accessibility is non-negotiable:

- **WCAG AA compliance**: Minimum standard for all elements
- **Screen reader friendly**: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full functionality without a mouse
- **Color blind safe**: Important information never relies on color alone

## Implementation

### CSS Architecture

We use modern CSS with:

- **CSS Variables**: For theming and consistency
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **CSS Modules**: For component isolation

### Component Library

Our components are built with:

- **React**: For interactive UI
- **Radix UI**: For accessible primitives
- **Framer Motion**: For thoughtful animations

## Contributing

When designing for Effect:

1. **Start with function**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Ensure consistency**: Does this fit our existing patterns?
3. **Test accessibility**: Can everyone use this?
4. **Optimize performance**: Is this the lightest solution?

This design system is a living document. As Effect evolves, so too will our design language, always maintaining our core principles of clarity, performance, and developer experience.
