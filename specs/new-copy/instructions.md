Create a plan for the new copy for the landing page redesign based on all you know about Effect so far.

You could also consider the following:

### Goal: positioning Effect

- What Effect is *now*
- Who is it for
- Why it matters

**Show the problem → show the solution → inspire confidence**

- **Light on code** – ****just enough detail to get them hooked
- **Link to docs, videos, or playground** where users can explore deeper
- **Social proof**
  

  

## **Value Proposition (Hero Section)**

> Production-grade software in TypeScript.

> Effect is the all-in-one, type-safe ecosystem for building reliable, scalable applications. From structured concurrency to error handling and observability, Effect gives you everything you need to manage complexity with confidence.

> Why Effect?

**Text:**

Modern TypeScript apps face a familiar set of challenges:

- Async workflows that sprawl into tangled Promise chains
- Dependencies and global state that grow harder to manage
- Errors that slip through the cracks
- Observability that’s bolted on too late

Effect gives you an all-in-one, type-safe foundation that keeps complexity low—even as your application grows.

With a production-grade TypeScript toolkit, you get everything you need to keep complexity under control—even as you scale.

## **Core Benefits**

**Section Title:**

> Built for the real world

**Pillars:**

✅ **Structured Concurrency**

Model async workflows declaratively. Safely cancel, compose, and supervise operations without hidden race conditions.

✅ **Type-Safe Dependency Injection**

Inject dependencies without global state or brittle plumbing. Everything is fully typed, composable, and testable.

✅ **Principled Error Handling**

Handle, transform, and recover from failures in a consistent, predictable way.

✅ **Observability by Default**

Built-in OpenTelemetry support and developer tools let you trace, debug, and visualize your system with zero guesswork.

✅ **Gradual Adoption**

Start small—use Effect as Promise++. Grow into advanced patterns only when you’re ready.

✅ Error Handling
    Treat errors as typed values, not exceptions.

✅ Retry
    Automatically retry failures with exponential backoff.

✅ Interruption
    Cancel operations cleanly and free up resources.

✅ Observability
    Trace requests and understand what’s running—live.

**Text:**

Effect doesn’t just promise clarity—it shows you.

With built-in developer tools, you can:

✅ **Trace and visualize your workflows** in real time, thanks to auto-running graphs.

✅ **Monitor retries, cancellations, and resource cleanup** effortlessly.

✅ **Understand system behavior at a glance**, no matter how complex it gets.

**Optional Subheading (if you want a shorter line):**

> Visualize your system as it runs

## **How It Works**

**Section Title:**

> A foundation for scalable TypeScript

**Text:**

Effect combines:

- Declarative computations (“effects”)
- A robust runtime for predictable execution
- A type-safe schema system for validating and transforming data

Together, these tools help you build systems that are reliable from the first line of code.

With built-in developer tools and auto-running visualizations, you can:
✅ Trace your workflows in real time
✅ Watch retries, interruptions, and cleanups as they happen
✅ Understand complex async behavior at a glance

A section for devtools would be useful too

## **Additional Notes for Implementation:**

- Open-telemetry, devtools etc really cool stuff. They deserve more love and showcase in the website.

- Move the third section ("Production-grade TypeScript") to the top and make the graph auto run so I can immediately visualize the graph diff

- Include in FAQ: what the unfamiliar syntax unlock for us (what can't we do without it). This can flip the perspective from "this is over engineering" to "this is nice"

- Find a way to Add latest effect version to navbar

- Dependency injection is the part that has been mostly praised by developers also
