*Kit's interactive examples* ([Visual Effects](https://effect.kitlangton.com/)) - *ideally connected to the most desired JS features*

## **See Effect in action**

Tap the following effects to run, interrupt, or reset them.

E.g.: Effect.succeed - Effect.fail - Effect.die - Effect.sync - Effect.promise

The Problem: highlight pain points TS devs hit as systems grow

## **TypeScript doesn‚Äôt scale on its own**

You build with Promises, singletons, and utility libraries. It works‚Ä¶ until your app grows.

- Async flows turn into spaghetti
- Errors go uncaught until production
- Tests become painful
- Global state leaks across modules
- Logs tell you something failed, but not what or where

Effect gives you the runtime layer TypeScript was missing.

Core Benefits Section: why Effect

## **Designed for real-world complexity. Built for scale.**

Effect is what you wish existed when your codebase hit 10K lines.

- Dependency injection ‚Äî no decorators, no magic. Just services you declare, provide, and test.
- Structured concurrency ‚Äî Fork, cancel, race, supervise‚Äîthen trace it all in real time.
- Errors as first-class values ‚Äî Every function tracks not just what it returns‚Äîbut what can go wrong.
- Resilience ‚Äî retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, backoffs‚Äîout of the box.
- Built-in observability ‚Äî OpenTelemetry, logs, traces by default
- Batteries actually included ‚Äî Schema validation, resource management, config parsing, state, cron, streams, test clocks, retry policies, and more.

### **Effect for AI**

Building LLM workflows, agents, and pipelines is a complex task ‚Äì requiring retries, fallbacks, streaming, cancellation, and tracing‚Äîall in one place.

Effect gives AI systems a safe, testable runtime:

- Fork & cancel tool calls or model chains
- Retry and fallback with typed error handling
- Inject and swap models or APIs for testing
- Trace every step automatically‚Äîno boilerplate

**AI with Effect**

*The goal is to give an instant, low-friction way to try Effect + Claude*

## Leverage AI with Effect

Effect's structured design makes it perfect for AI-assisted development.

### With Effect MCP (Model Context Protocol), Claude understands:

- How to compose effects properly
- When to handle errors vs propagate them
- Where to inject dependencies
- Why your code needs certain patterns

### Why it works:

- Predictable patterns
Generators, yield*, and tagged errors guide the AI toward correct compositions
- Self-documenting code
Type signatures tell the full story: inputs, outputs, errors, dependencies

Try it instantly (code snippet)

Technical Foundation (code-light, links to docs.)

## How Effect works

A complete system ‚Äì not just utilities.

Three Pillars:

### Effects

Composable, declarative descriptions of what your program does. Think Promises‚Äîsupercharged with typed errors, tracked dependencies, and interruption.

### **Runtime**

A lightweight, fiber-based runtime that powers structured concurrency, resource management, and deterministic workflows.

### Schema

Define data once. Use it for parsing, validation, serialization, migration, and more. Schema is your source of truth across boundaries.

## Frequently Asked Questions

---

**Q: Why does Effect's syntax look different from typical TypeScript?**
Effect code looks strange at first, like a whole new language inside TypeScript. But there‚Äôs a reason for that.

That ‚Äúweirdness‚Äù unlocks:

- Typed, composable errors
- Dependency injection with no globals
- Interruptible workflows
- Business logic you can reason about, reuse, and test in isolation

It‚Äôs not overengineering. It‚Äôs engineering that holds up under pressure.

**Q: Do I have to know FP?**
No. Matt Pocock explains this best in his video on why he changed his mind about Effect (link to video).

**Q: How does Effect compare to other libraries?**

- RxJS ‚Üí
- fp-ts ‚Üí
- NestJS ‚Üí
- Zod ‚Üí

**Q: How long does it take to learn?**
You can be productive in a few days. Start by replacing await with yield*, everything else follows naturally.

**Q: What about performance?**
Effect adds minimal overhead and prevents the *real* performance killers:

- Memory leaks
- Orphaned async ops
- Resource exhaustion
- Inconsistent error handling
